##### Executive Summary

The aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining safety, performance, and economic viability. This technical analysis evaluates potential energy sources for next-generation aircraft propulsion systems by comparing their gravimetric and volumetric energy densities, storage requirements, infrastructure compatibility, and airframe design implications.

Based on a target mission energy requirement of 867,529 MJ (equivalent to a typical long-range commercial flight), this study analyzes Jet-A (baseline), Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK), Hydrotreated Renewable Jet fuel (HRJ), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), liquid hydrogen, compressed hydrogen, lithium-ion batteries, and hybrid propulsion systems.

**Key Finding:** Drop-in Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) such as FT-SPK or HRJ represent the most practical solution for next-generation propulsion entering service within the next decade, offering emissions reduction without major airframe redesign or infrastructure overhaul.

##### Methodology

**Energy Requirement Baseline:**
The analysis uses a reference mission energy of 867,529 MJ, representative of a long-range commercial aircraft mission (approximately 8,000 nautical miles with typical payload). This baseline enables direct comparison of mass and volume requirements across all fuel types.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. **Gravimetric Energy Density**: Energy per unit mass (MJ/kg) — critical for aircraft range and payload
2. **Volumetric Energy Density**: Energy per unit volume (MJ/L) — determines tank size and airframe integration
3. **Storage Requirements**: Temperature, pressure, and material constraints
4. **Infrastructure Compatibility**: Existing airport fuel systems, distribution networks, and refueling equipment
5. **Design Implications**: Required modifications to airframe, propulsion system, and certification basis
6. **Economic Viability**: Approximate fuel cost per megajoule of delivered energy

**Calculation Example:**
For liquid hydrogen with 120 MJ/kg gravimetric density:
- Required mass = 867,529 MJ ÷ 120 MJ/kg = 7,230 kg
- Required volume = 867,529 MJ ÷ 8.5 MJ/L = 102,000 L

This represents a 4× volume increase over Jet-A despite 65% mass reduction, necessitating major fuselage or wing tank redesign.

##### Recommendation Rationale

After comprehensive evaluation, **drop-in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)** emerges as the optimal choice for next-generation propulsion systems entering service within 2026-2035:

**Performance Alignment:**
SAF fuels (FT-SPK, HRJ) provide nearly identical energy densities to Jet-A (43.5-44.0 vs 42.8 MJ/kg), enabling existing aircraft to maintain range, payload, and operational capabilities without performance degradation.

**Infrastructure Compatibility:**
As drop-in fuels, SAF requires no modifications to airport fuel farms, hydrant systems, refueling trucks, or aircraft fuel systems. This eliminates billions in infrastructure investment and accelerates fleet-wide adoption.

**Certification Pathway:**
SAF blends up to 50% are already ASTM D7566 approved and fly commercially today. Full 100% SAF certification is expected by 2027, leveraging decades of jet fuel safety data rather than starting from scratch.

**Emissions Reduction:**
Depending on feedstock (waste oils, agricultural residues, synthetic pathways), SAF can reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by 50-80% compared to conventional Jet-A while maintaining identical combustion characteristics.

**Risk Mitigation:**
Unlike hydrogen or battery-electric propulsion, SAF deployment carries minimal technical risk. Existing turbofan engines, fuel systems, and maintenance procedures remain valid, preserving airlines' operational expertise.

**Economic Transition:**
While SAF currently costs 2-4× conventional jet fuel, production scaling and policy incentives (ReFuelEU in Europe, tax credits in the US) are driving costs down. Airlines can phase in SAF procurement without grounding fleets or investing in new aircraft.

##### Why Not Hydrogen?

Liquid hydrogen presents an attractive long-term vision for zero-carbon aviation but faces formidable near-term obstacles:

**Volume Penalty:**
Hydrogen's 8.5 MJ/L volumetric density requires tanks 4-5× larger than Jet-A. For widebody aircraft, this necessitates:
- Fuselage-mounted pressure vessels (reducing passenger/cargo capacity)
- Thickened wing structures (increasing structural weight)
- Complete aerodynamic redesign (invalidating existing type certificates)

**Cryogenic Complexity:**
Maintaining 20 K storage temperatures demands:
- Multi-layer vacuum-insulated tanks with boil-off management
- Active refrigeration systems adding weight and power consumption
- Specialized airport infrastructure (liquefaction plants, cryogenic pumps)
- Stringent safety protocols for flammable cryogenic handling

**Infrastructure Investment:**
Global transition to hydrogen aviation requires:
- $100B+ airport infrastructure overhaul (conservative estimate)
- Hydrogen production at scale via electrolysis (requiring massive renewable energy expansion)
- New fuel distribution networks separate from existing hydrocarbon systems

**Certification Timeline:**
Hydrogen aircraft represent a clean-sheet design requiring:
- 10-15 years development and certification (comparable to new aircraft programs)
- Extensive safety testing of novel failure modes (tank rupture, rapid decompression, combustion)
- Regulatory framework development (current standards assume hydrocarbon fuels)

**Conclusion:** Hydrogen is a critical technology for post-2040 aviation but cannot address the 2026-2035 emissions reduction imperative.

##### Why Not Batteries?

Battery-electric propulsion suffers from fundamental physics limitations:

**Energy Density Gap:**
At 0.9 MJ/kg, current Li-ion batteries store 47× less energy per kilogram than Jet-A. Even with optimistic projections of 1.5 MJ/kg by 2035, the gap remains insurmountable for commercial aviation.

**Mass Penalty:**
For the reference 867,529 MJ mission:
- Jet-A: 20,270 kg
- Batteries: 963,920 kg (47× heavier)

This mass exceeds the maximum takeoff weight of most commercial aircraft, rendering long-range battery-electric flight physically impossible with foreseeable technology.

**Range Limitations:**
Battery-electric aircraft are constrained to:
- Short routes: <500 km practical range
- Small aircraft: Typically <20 passengers
- Niche applications: Urban air mobility, flight training

**Charging Infrastructure:**
Recharging 964 metric tons of batteries requires megawatt-scale charging infrastructure and multi-hour ground times, incompatible with airline operational models (30-45 minute turnarounds).

**Application:** Batteries will enable urban air mobility and electrify general aviation, but cannot support commercial airline operations in the foreseeable future.

##### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Immediate Deployment (2026-2027)**
- Increase SAF blend ratios from current 50% to 100% as certification completes
- Establish long-term SAF offtake agreements between airlines and producers
- Scale production via waste-based feedstocks (used cooking oil, forestry residues)

**Phase 2: Production Scaling (2028-2032)**
- Deploy advanced SAF pathways: alcohol-to-jet (ATJ), power-to-liquid (PtL)
- Achieve cost parity with fossil Jet-A through economies of scale and policy support
- Mandate SAF percentages in aviation fuel supply (e.g., ReFuelEU's 2% by 2026, 70% by 2050)

**Phase 3: Hydrogen Transition (2033-2040)**
- Certify first-generation hydrogen regional aircraft (100-150 seats, <2000 km range)
- Develop airport hydrogen infrastructure at key hubs
- Parallel-path battery-electric technology for urban air mobility and short-haul

**Phase 4: Full Decarbonization (2040-2050)**
- Hydrogen narrowbody aircraft for mainline routes
- SAF for long-haul widebody where hydrogen volumetric penalty remains prohibitive
- Portfolio approach: right fuel for right mission profile

##### Key Assumptions and Limitations

**Energy Requirement:**
The 867,529 MJ baseline represents a typical long-range mission but does not account for reserves, taxi fuel, or operational contingencies. Actual fuel loads include 5-10% additional capacity per regulatory requirements.

**Technology Readiness:**
Energy densities reflect current state-of-the-art. Battery projections assume incremental lithium-ion improvements, not breakthrough solid-state or lithium-air technologies that remain speculative.

**Cost Estimates:**
Fuel costs are approximate 2026 values and highly sensitive to:
- Crude oil prices (Jet-A, SAF feedstock competition)
- Renewable electricity costs (hydrogen electrolysis, PtL SAF)
- Carbon pricing policies (EU ETS, potential US carbon tax)

**Lifecycle Emissions:**
SAF emissions reduction percentages are lifecycle (well-to-wake) values, not combustion-only. Actual carbon intensity varies by feedstock, production pathway, and land-use change assumptions.

**Infrastructure Compatibility:**
"Drop-in" assumes compliance with ASTM D7566 and compatibility with existing turbine combustors. Some SAF pathways require minor seal or gasket material changes in older aircraft.

##### Conclusion

The path to sustainable aviation is a phased transition, not a single technological leap. Drop-in Sustainable Aviation Fuel represents the optimal bridge technology, delivering immediate emissions reductions while preserving operational continuity and economic viability.

Hydrogen and battery-electric propulsion will play critical roles in the post-2035 landscape, but their deployment timelines, infrastructure requirements, and performance trade-offs make them unsuitable for near-term fleet-wide adoption.

For aerospace engineers developing next-generation propulsion systems today, **SAF provides the highest probability of technical success, lowest certification risk, and fastest pathway to meaningful carbon reduction**—making it the recommended energy source for aircraft entering service within the next decade.
