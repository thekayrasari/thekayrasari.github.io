fuel efficiency, thrust performance, weight, noise, and emissions. This analysis examines the two fundamental architectural parameters that define engine behavior—Bypass Ratio (BPR) and Overall Pressure Ratio (OPR)—and the physical limits constraining their optimization.\nHigh-bypass turbofans dominate commercial aviation because they maximize propulsive efficiency at subsonic cruise speeds, achieving fuel savings of 15-25% compared to earlier low-bypass designs. However, increasing BPR indefinitely encounters hard limits: fan blade tip speeds must remain subsonic to avoid noise and structural penalties, and larger fans impose weight and drag penalties that eventually negate efficiency gains.\nSimilarly, increasing compression ratios improves thermal efficiency but creates formidable challenges: compressor exit temperatures approach material limits requiring exotic superalloys or ceramic matrix composites, and high combustion temperatures exponentially increase NOx emissions, conflicting with environmental regulations.\nThis presentation uses real-world case studies—the Boeing 737/Airbus A320 family (BPR ~5-11:1) for commercial optimization and the F-35 Lightning II (BPR ~0.57:1) for tactical applications—to illustrate how mission profiles dictate architecture. We conclude by examining CFM International’s Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program, which employs open-fan architecture and advanced ceramics to target a remarkable 75:1 bypass ratio and 20% emissions reduction.\nPresentation Structure Introduction \u0026 Objectives — Defining key metrics and design goals Bypass Ratio Fundamentals — How air mass flow distribution affects performance High-BPR Optimization — Commercial aviation’s efficiency imperative Low-BPR Applications — Tactical aviation’s speed and stealth requirements BPR Limiting Factors — Tip speed constraints and installation penalties Compression Ratio Fundamentals — Thermodynamic efficiency principles OPR Material Limits — Heat-resistant alloys and structural challenges OPR Emissions Constraints — NOx formation and regulatory compliance Innovation Case Study — CFM RISE program breakthrough technologies Design Trade-off Matrix — Systematic comparison of architectural choices Recommendations — Optimal architecture for subsonic commercial missions Figure 1: Bypass Ratio Architecture Core Air Flow:\nCompressed to high pressure (15-50:1 ratio) Mixed with fuel in combustor Ignited to produce high-temperature, high-velocity exhaust Drives turbines that power fan and compressor Bypass Air Flow:\nAccelerated by fan but bypasses engine core Produces thrust through momentum change (mass × velocity) Accounts for 75-90% of total thrust in high-bypass engines Bypass Ratio Definition:\nBPR = (Mass flow rate of bypass air) / (Mass flow rate of core air) Application Examples:\nCommercial turbofans (Boeing 737 MAX, A320neo): BPR = 9-12:1 Business jets (Gulfstream, Citation): BPR = 4-6:1 Tactical fighters (F-35, F-22): BPR = 0.2-0.6:1 Early turbojets (1950s-1970s): BPR = 0:1 (no bypass flow) High-Bypass Architecture: Commercial Optimization Propulsive Efficiency Advantage:\nThe fundamental physics of thrust generation favors moving large air masses at moderate velocities over small masses at high velocities. Propulsive efficiency η_p is approximated by:\nη_p = 2 / (1 + V_exhaust / V_aircraft) For subsonic cruise (Mach 0.78-0.85, ~450 knots):\nHigh-BPR turbofan: V_exhaust ≈ 800-900 ft/s → η_p ≈ 85-90% Low-BPR turbojet: V_exhaust ≈ 1,500-2,000 ft/s → η_p ≈ 60-70% This 15-20 percentage point efficiency advantage translates directly to fuel savings.\nSpecific Fuel Consumption (SFC) Reduction:\nModern high-bypass turbofans achieve:\nCruise SFC: 0.45-0.55 lb fuel/(lb thrust·hour) Older low-bypass engines: 0.70-0.90 lb fuel/(lb thrust·hour) This represents a 35-50% fuel consumption reduction for equivalent thrust.\nAcoustic Benefits:\nThe slow-moving bypass air creates a low-velocity sheath around the high-velocity core exhaust, effectively acting as a muffler:\nJet noise scales with V^8 (velocity to the eighth power) High-bypass engines produce 15-20 dB less noise than equivalent-thrust turbojets Enables compliance with FAA Stage 5 and ICAO Chapter 14 noise regulations Real-World Implementation:\nBoeing 737 MAX (CFM LEAP-1B engine):\nBypass ratio: ~9:1 Fan diameter: 69.4 inches Cruise SFC: ~0.47 lb/(lb·hr) Airbus A320neo (Pratt \u0026 Whitney PW1100G):\nBypass ratio: ~12:1 Fan diameter: 81 inches Geared turbofan architecture enables higher BPR 16% fuel burn improvement over previous generation Low-Bypass Architecture: Tactical Applications High-Speed Performance Requirements:\nSupersonic flight fundamentally changes propulsion requirements:\nOptimal exhaust velocity approaches aircraft velocity for maximum efficiency At Mach 1.5+, high core flow with minimal bypass produces superior thrust Ram pressure recovery in intake provides “free” compression at high speed F-35 Lightning II (Pratt \u0026 Whitney F135):\nBypass ratio: ~0.57:1 Maximum thrust: 43,000 lbf (28,000 lbf military, 43,000 lbf afterburner) Specific thrust: Exceptionally high (~180 lb thrust per lb/sec airflow) Stealth and Frontal Area:\nLow-observable (stealth) requirements favor small cross-sections:\nLarge fans create significant radar returns Smaller engines reduce frontal area by 40-60% compared to equivalent high-bypass designs Enables conformal installation within fuselage contours Thrust Density:\nMilitary missions prioritize thrust-to-weight ratio:\nSmaller core diameter = lighter engine structure Higher specific thrust (thrust per unit of airflow) Enables extreme maneuverability (9G turns, vertical climbs) Bypass Ratio Limiting Factors Fan Blade Tip Speed Constraint:\nFan blade tips must remain subsonic to avoid:\nShock wave formation: Dramatically increases noise and reduces efficiency Structural vibration: Transonic buffeting causes fatigue failures Performance degradation: Shockwaves create pressure losses Tip Speed Calculation:\nV_tip = (π × D × RPM) / 60\rWhere:\rD = fan diameter (meters)\rRPM = rotational speed (revolutions per minute)\rV_tip = tip velocity (m/s) Design Constraint: Mach 0.75-0.9 limit (250-300 m/s at sea level) forces a trade-off:\nLarger diameter → must reduce RPM → requires gearbox (added weight/complexity) Higher RPM → limits maximum diameter → constrains BPR Geared Turbofan Solution:\nPratt \u0026 Whitney’s PurePower gearbox:\n3:1 gear reduction ratio Allows fan to operate at optimal low speed while core turbine spins at high speed Enables BPR ~12:1 vs ~9:1 for direct-drive competitors Weight penalty: ~300-400 lbs, offset by efficiency gains Installation Penalties:\nWeight Escalation:\nComponent Mass Scaling (approximate):\rFan: ∝ D^2.5\rNacelle: ∝ D^2\rPylon/Mounting: ∝ D^1.8 For a 20% diameter increase:\nFan mass increases ~33% Total engine installation weight increases ~20-25% Aerodynamic Drag:\nLarger nacelles create:\nParasite drag: Proportional to frontal area (∝ D^2) Installation drag: Flow interference with wing and fuselage Ground clearance: May require longer landing gear (added weight/drag) Break-Even Point:\nAnalysis suggests BPR ~15-18:1 represents the practical limit for podded engines before installation penalties exceed efficiency gains. Beyond this, open-rotor or distributed propulsion architectures become necessary.\nOverall Pressure Ratio (OPR): Thermodynamic Fundamentals Thermal Efficiency Relationship:\nBrayton cycle thermal efficiency increases with pressure ratio:\nη_thermal ≈ 1 - (1/π^((γ-1)/γ))\rWhere:\rπ = overall pressure ratio (OPR)\rγ = specific heat ratio (≈1.4 for air) Practical Implications:\nOPR Thermal Efficiency Era 5:1 ~40% Early turbojets (1950s) 15:1 ~52% 1970s-1980s engines 30:1 ~58% 1990s-2000s (CFM56, V2500) 40:1 ~61% Modern (LEAP, PW1000G) 50:1+ ~63% Future (RISE, UltraFan) Each doubling of OPR yields diminishing returns: early gains are dramatic, but moving from 40:1 to 60:1 produces only marginal efficiency improvement.\nCompressor Work and Temperature Rise:\nCompressing air requires work, which appears as temperature rise:\nT_exit / T_inlet = π^((γ-1)/γ)\rFor π = 40:1:\rT_exit = T_inlet × 40^0.286 = T_inlet × 3.48\rAt sea level (288K inlet):\rT_exit ≈ 1,000K (727°C / 1,340°F) This occurs before combustion—material limits become severe.\nOPR Limiting Factor 1: Material Constraints Compressor Exit Temperature Challenge:\nHigh-pressure compressor (HPC) exit temperatures approach or exceed:\nAluminum alloys: Maximum ~150°C (useless for HPC) Titanium alloys: Creep limit ~550-600°C Nickel superalloys: Creep limit ~750-850°C Ceramic matrix composites (CMC): Operational to 1,200-1,400°C Current Technology Solutions:\nNickel-Based Superalloys (Inconel, René alloys):\nSingle-crystal turbine blades grown without grain boundaries Directional solidification eliminates weak points Cost: $1,000-$10,000 per blade depending on complexity Used in hottest sections (high-pressure turbine) Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC):\nYttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramic coatings Provides 100-200°C temperature reduction at metal surface Enables operation 150-200°C beyond bare alloy limits Internal Cooling Systems:\nFilm cooling: Bleed air through thousands of tiny holes Impingement cooling: Jets of air onto internal surfaces Penalty: Cooling air represents 15-25% of compressor flow, reducing efficiency Next-Generation: Ceramic Matrix Composites:\nGE Aviation’s CMC turbine components:\nSilicon carbide fiber in silicon carbide matrix (SiC/SiC) 1/3 the density of nickel superalloys Operates 200-300°C hotter with reduced or eliminated cooling Used in GE9X (Boeing 777X) and targeted for LEAP-X successors Cost-Benefit Trade-off:\nEach 10-point OPR increase requires:\nAdvanced materials: +$500K to $2M per engine Complex cooling: +5-8% SFC penalty (offsets some thermal efficiency gain) Durability testing: +18-24 months development time OPR Limiting Factor 2: Emissions (NOx Formation) High-Temperature Chemistry:\nNitrogen oxides (NO and NO₂, collectively NOx) form via thermal dissociation:\nN₂ + O₂ → 2NO (at high temperature)\r2NO + O₂ → 2NO₂ Exponential Temperature Dependence:\nNOx formation rate follows the Zeldovich mechanism:\nNegligible below ~1,400K Doubles approximately every 90K above 1,600K Peak formation at stoichiometric combustion (~2,200-2,400K) The Engineering Dilemma:\nHigher OPR → Higher T₃ (combustor inlet temp)\r→ Higher flame temperature\r→ Exponentially more NOx\rBut also:\rHigher OPR → Better thermal efficiency\r→ Less fuel burned per thrust\r→ Lower CO₂ emissions Regulatory Pressure:\nICAO CAEP standards progressively tighten NOx limits:\nCAEP/2 (1999): Baseline CAEP/4 (2004): -16% vs CAEP/2 CAEP/6 (2008): -12% vs CAEP/4 (cumulative -27% vs CAEP/2) CAEP/8 (2014): -15% vs CAEP/6 (cumulative -38% vs CAEP/2) Future CAEP/10+: Projected -50% vs CAEP/2 Each generation requires breakthrough combustor technology to maintain or increase OPR while meeting tighter limits.\nMitigation Strategies:\nLean-Burn Combustors (used in LEAP, PW1000G):\nOperate fuel-lean (excess air) to reduce peak flame temperature Requires robust fuel staging to prevent lean blowout Achieves 50-60% NOx reduction vs conventional designs Rich-Quench-Lean (RQL) Staging:\nPrimary zone: fuel-rich (low temperature, incomplete combustion) Quench zone: rapid mixing with air Lean zone: complete combustion at moderate temperature Complex airflow management prevents flashback Future: Variable Geometry Combustors:\nAdjust fuel staging and airflow distribution with power setting Optimize for low NOx at all conditions (takeoff, cruise, idle) Adds mechanical complexity and potential failure modes Innovation Case Study: CFM RISE Program Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE):\nCFM International (GE/Safran joint venture) targets 2030s entry into service with step-change improvements:\nOpen-Fan Architecture:\nTraditional turbofans encase the fan in a heavy nacelle. RISE removes this constraint:\nUnducted fan: No nacelle drag or weight Counter-rotating propellers: Eliminates swirl losses, increases efficiency Target BPR: ~75:1 (vs ~12:1 for current best-in-class) Design Benefits:\nFan diameter unconstrained by nacelle packaging Thinner, more efficient blades possible without ground clearance issues Predicted 20% fuel consumption improvement over current engines Design Challenges:\nNoise: Open blades without acoustic treatment Mitigation: Advanced blade shaping, variable pitch for optimal approach speeds Foreign object damage: No inlet to screen debris Mitigation: Composite blades with damage tolerance Installation: Non-traditional mounting, certification basis uncertain Ceramic Matrix Composite Integration:\nRISE will employ CMCs extensively:\nTurbine components: 1,200°C+ operating temperatures Hot-section structures: Reduced cooling requirements Weight savings: 30% reduction in turbine weight Enables higher OPR (55-60:1 target) with manageable material costs.\nHybrid-Electric Power Offtake:\nRISE incorporates electrical generation capability:\nMegawatt-class generators embedded in core Enables electrified aircraft systems (ECS, hydraulics, de-icing) Potential for hybrid-electric propulsion augmentation Performance Targets:\nMetric | Current (LEAP) | RISE Target | Improvement\r---------------------|-----------------|----------------|------------\rFuel Consumption | Baseline | -20% | 20% reduction\rCO₂ Emissions | Baseline | -20% | 20% reduction\rNOx Emissions | CAEP/8 compliant| Beyond CAEP/10 | 50%+ reduction\rBypass Ratio | 9-11:1 | ~75:1 | 7× increase\rOverall Pressure Ratio| 40:1 | 55-60:1 | 50% increase Development Timeline:\n2021: Program launch, architecture selection 2023-2025: Component testing (combustor, CMC turbine) 2025-2028: Full engine ground testing 2030s: Certification and entry into service Risk Assessment:\nHigh technical risk: Open-fan architecture unproven in commercial service Certification uncertainty: No existing regulatory framework for unducted fans Market acceptance: Airlines may resist unconventional configuration despite efficiency gains Design Trade-off Matrix Parameter Optimization Goal Benefits Negative Trade-offs High BPR (9-12:1) Fuel Efficiency \u0026 Noise • 15-20% better SFC• 15-20 dB noise reduction• Lower emissions per thrust • Larger nacelle drag• Heavier installation (+20-25%)• Landing gear extension• Tip speed constraints Ultra-High BPR (75:1) Maximum Efficiency • 20% fuel consumption reduction• Potential 30% CO₂ reduction • Open-fan noise challenges• FOD vulnerability• Certification risk• Unknown market acceptance Low BPR (0.2-0.6:1) Supersonic Performance • High specific thrust• Compact installation• Low frontal area (stealth) • Poor subsonic efficiency• High SFC (+50-70%)• Increased noise High OPR (40-50:1) Thermal Efficiency • 58-63% thermal efficiency• Lower fuel consumption• Reduced CO₂ per thrust • Exotic materials ($M cost)• Exponential NOx formation• Complex cooling (SFC penalty)• Longer development time Ultra-High OPR (60:1+) Maximum Thermal Efficiency • Marginal efficiency gains (~2-3%)• Technology demonstration • Severe NOx challenges• CMC required (supply chain risk)• Diminishing returns on efficiency• Certification complexity Compact Core Weight Reduction • Lower empty weight• Improved thrust-to-weight • Higher pressure losses• Increased cooling requirements• Combustor volume constraints Multi-Dimensional Optimization:\nNo single “optimal” design exists—architecture must match mission profile:\nLong-Range Subsonic Commercial (777, A350):\nMaximize BPR (9-12:1) for cruise efficiency Moderate-high OPR (40-45:1) balancing efficiency and NOx Accept weight/drag penalties for 20-year fuel savings Short-Haul Regional (A220, E-Jet):\nModerate BPR (6-9:1) balancing efficiency and compact installation High OPR for fuel efficiency on frequent climbs Prioritize low acquisition cost Business Aviation (Gulfstream, Global):\nModerate BPR (4-6:1) for acceptable efficiency with high cruise speed High OPR for range and fuel economy Compact installation for twin-engine configurations Military Tactical (F-35, Rafale):\nLow BPR (0.2-0.6:1) for supersonic capability Moderate OPR (25-30:1) balancing efficiency and reliability Maximize thrust-to-weight and specific thrust Recommendations \u0026 Next Steps For Subsonic Commercial Applications (Boeing 737, A320 competitors):\nPrimary Recommendation: Pursue a high-bypass geared turbofan architecture or evaluate open-rotor technology for next-generation platforms.\nRationale:\nMission Profile: Subsonic cruise (Mach 0.78-0.82) dominates 95%+ of flight time—propulsive efficiency is paramount Regulatory Environment: Tightening noise (ICAO Chapter 14) and emissions (CAEP/10+) regulations favor high-BPR designs Economic Imperative: Fuel represents 25-35% of airline operating costs—even 5% SFC improvement yields substantial savings Technology Maturity: Geared turbofan proven in service (PW1000G);

While theoretical analysis suggests always increasing BPR and OPR, practical limits force engineering compromises:\nBypass Ratio:\nHigh values (9-15:1) optimize subsonic commercial missions Limited by fan tip speed, installation weight/drag, and ground clearance Breakthrough technologies (geared turbofans, open rotors) push limits beyond traditional constraints Overall Pressure Ratio:\nHigher values improve thermal efficiency but encounter material temperature limits Creates exponential NOx formation requiring sophisticated combustor design Diminishing returns above 50:1 unless coupled with CMC technology Path Forward: The CFM RISE program demonstrates that significant efficiency gains remain achievable through integrated innovation: open-fan architecture for maximum BPR, CMC components for higher OPR, and advanced combustors for emissions compliance.\nFor aerospace engineers developing next-generation propulsion systems, success requires balancing aggressive performance targets with certification risk, development cost, and market acceptance—making informed trade-offs guided by rigorous thermodynamic analysis and engineering judgment.\nTechnical Appendix Propulsive Efficiency Derivation:\nThrust = ṁ(V_exhaust - V_aircraft)\rPropulsive Power = Thrust × V_aircraft = ṁ V_aircraft (V_exhaust - V_aircraft)\rKinetic Power = (1/2) ṁ (V_exhaust² - V_aircraft²)\rη_propulsive = Propulsive Power / Kinetic Power\r= 2 V_aircraft (V_exhaust - V_aircraft) / (V_exhaust² - V_aircraft²)\r= 2 / (1 + V_exhaust / V_aircraft) This shows efficiency approaches 100% as V_exhaust → V_aircraft, favoring high mass flow at velocities matching flight speed.\nBrayton Cycle Efficiency:\nη_thermal = 1 - (T₁/T₃)\r= 1 - (P₁/P₃)^((γ-1)/γ)\r= 1 - (1/π)^((γ-1)/γ)\rWhere:\rT₁, P₁ = compressor inlet temperature, pressure\rT₃, P₃ = combustor exit temperature, pressure π = OPR = P₃/P₁\rγ = specific heat ratio ≈ 1.4 for air Zeldovich NOx Formation Mechanism:\nO + N₂ ⇌ NO + N (rate-limiting step)\rN + O₂ ⇌ NO + O (fast)\rN + OH ⇌ NO + H (fast) Formation rate strongly dependent on temperature and residence time in high-temperature zone.\nReferences and Further Reading Mattingly, J.D.

This analysis examines the two fundamental architectural parameters that define engine behavior—<strong>Bypass Ratio (BPR)</strong> and <strong>Overall Pressure Ratio (OPR)</strong>—and the physical limits constraining their optimization.</p><p>High-bypass turbofans dominate commercial aviation because they maximize propulsive efficiency at subsonic cruise speeds, achieving fuel savings of 15-25% compared to earlier low-bypass designs. However, increasing BPR indefinitely encounters hard limits: fan blade tip speeds must remain subsonic to avoid noise and structural penalties, and larger fans impose weight and drag penalties that eventually negate efficiency gains.</p><p>Similarly, increasing compression ratios improves thermal efficiency but creates formidable challenges: compressor exit temperatures approach material limits requiring exotic superalloys or ceramic matrix composites, and high combustion temperatures exponentially increase NOx emissions, conflicting with environmental regulations.</p><p>This presentation uses real-world case studies—the Boeing 737/Airbus A320 family (BPR ~5-11:1) for commercial optimization and the F-35 Lightning II (BPR ~0.57:1) for tactical applications—to illustrate how mission profiles dictate architecture. We conclude by examining CFM International&rsquo;s Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program, which employs open-fan architecture and advanced ceramics to target a remarkable 75:1 bypass ratio and 20% emissions reduction.</p><hr><h5 id=presentation-structure>Presentation Structure<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#presentation-structure>#</a></h5><ol><li><strong>Introduction & Objectives</strong> — Defining key metrics and design goals</li><li><strong>Bypass Ratio Fundamentals</strong> — How air mass flow distribution affects performance</li><li><strong>High-BPR Optimization</strong> — Commercial aviation&rsquo;s efficiency imperative</li><li><strong>Low-BPR Applications</strong> — Tactical aviation&rsquo;s speed and stealth requirements</li><li><strong>BPR Limiting Factors</strong> — Tip speed constraints and installation penalties</li><li><strong>Compression Ratio Fundamentals</strong> — Thermodynamic efficiency principles</li><li><strong>OPR Material Limits</strong> — Heat-resistant alloys and structural challenges</li><li><strong>OPR Emissions Constraints</strong> — NOx formation and regulatory compliance</li><li><strong>Innovation Case Study</strong> — CFM RISE program breakthrough technologies</li><li><strong>Design Trade-off Matrix</strong> — Systematic comparison of architectural choices</li><li><strong>Recommendations</strong> — Optimal architecture for subsonic commercial missions</li></ol><hr><h5 id=figure-1-bypass-ratio-architecture>Figure 1: Bypass Ratio Architecture<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#figure-1-bypass-ratio-architecture>#</a></h5><p><strong>Core Air Flow:</strong></p><ul><li>Compressed to high pressure (15-50:1 ratio)</li><li>Mixed with fuel in combustor</li><li>Ignited to produce high-temperature, high-velocity exhaust</li><li>Drives turbines that power fan and compressor</li></ul><p><strong>Bypass Air Flow:</strong></p><ul><li>Accelerated by fan but bypasses engine core</li><li>Produces thrust through momentum change (mass × velocity)</li><li>Accounts for 75-90% of total thrust in high-bypass engines</li></ul><p><strong>Bypass Ratio Definition:</strong></p><pre tabindex=0><code>BPR = (Mass flow rate of bypass air) / (Mass flow rate of core air)

While theoretical analysis suggests always increasing BPR and OPR, practical limits force engineering compromises:</p><p><strong>Bypass Ratio:</strong></p><ul><li>High values (9-15:1) optimize subsonic commercial missions</li><li>Limited by fan tip speed, installation weight/drag, and ground clearance</li><li>Breakthrough technologies (geared turbofans, open rotors) push limits beyond traditional constraints</li></ul><p><strong>Overall Pressure Ratio:</strong></p><ul><li>Higher values improve thermal efficiency but encounter material temperature limits</li><li>Creates exponential NOx formation requiring sophisticated combustor design</li><li>Diminishing returns above 50:1 unless coupled with CMC technology</li></ul><p><strong>Path Forward:</strong>
The CFM RISE program demonstrates that significant efficiency gains remain achievable through integrated innovation: open-fan architecture for maximum BPR, CMC components for higher OPR, and advanced combustors for emissions compliance.</p><p>For aerospace engineers developing next-generation propulsion systems, success requires balancing aggressive performance targets with certification risk, development cost, and market acceptance—making informed trade-offs guided by rigorous thermodynamic analysis and engineering judgment.</p><hr><h5 id=technical-appendix>Technical Appendix<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#technical-appendix>#</a></h5><p><strong>Propulsive Efficiency Derivation:</strong></p><pre tabindex=0><code>Thrust = ṁ(V_exhaust - V_aircraft)
Propulsive Power = Thrust × V_aircraft = ṁ V_aircraft (V_exhaust - V_aircraft)
Kinetic Power = (1/2) ṁ (V_exhaust² - V_aircraft²)

η_propulsive = Propulsive Power / Kinetic Power
            = 2 V_aircraft (V_exhaust - V_aircraft) / (V_exhaust² - V_aircraft²)
            = 2 / (1 + V_exhaust / V_aircraft)
</code></pre><p>This shows efficiency approaches 100% as V_exhaust → V_aircraft, favoring high mass flow at velocities matching flight speed.</p><p><strong>Brayton Cycle Efficiency:</strong></p><pre tabindex=0><code>η_thermal = 1 - (T₁/T₃)
         = 1 - (P₁/P₃)^((γ-1)/γ)
         = 1 - (1/π)^((γ-1)/γ)

Where:
T₁, P₁ = compressor inlet temperature, pressure
T₃, P₃ = combustor exit temperature, pressure  
π = OPR = P₃/P₁
γ = specific heat ratio ≈ 1.4 for air
